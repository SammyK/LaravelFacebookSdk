- Upgraded to use the latest Facebook PHP SDK ~~v4.1~~ **v5**.

- Removed the migration stub since there's only one column we need to add for most cases.
- Removed the config, route & view for the `channel.html` since that seems to be deprecated.

    - Renamed the `$facebook_field_aliases` static property to `$graph_node_field_aliases`.
